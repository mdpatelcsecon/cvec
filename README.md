# cvec

## A Dependency-Free Vector Data Structure Library for the C23 Programming Language

To build this libary just run `make build` with make and Clang installed.
Alternatively you can also simply take the C source files and headers and drop them
directly into your own project as they are C23 standard conforming and will compile
under any environment that supports that language standard.
